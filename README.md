# Road User Sentiment Analysis  

## Overview  
This project aims to analyze road user feedback by determining whether the sentiments expressed are **positive** or **negative**. The feedback is processed to visualize overall sentiment trends using graphs, providing insights into user satisfaction and areas needing improvement.  

The analysis is implemented in **Google Colab**, making it accessible and easy to use for quick deployment and testing.  

## Features  
- Collects user feedback through a text-based input system.  
- Performs **sentiment analysis** to classify feedback as positive or negative.  
- Generates visualizations (graphs) to display the sentiment distribution.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization  
  - `textblob` or `NLTK` (Natural Language Toolkit) for sentiment analysis  
  - `Google Colab` for an interactive coding environment  

## How It Works  
1. **Input Feedback:** Users can provide textual feedback about their road experience.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** The input is processed to determine the sentiment using NLP techniques.  
3. **Visualization:** The processed feedback is summarized into a bar graph or pie chart showing the percentage of positive and negative feedback.
